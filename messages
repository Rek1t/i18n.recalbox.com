faq7q = When I start games on some systems, the screen turns black and EmulationStation pops up again after few seconds.

blog-2017-02-06-workflow-content = <div>\
                        It’s been a while since our last update on the progress of the project. Be sure we don't forget you :)\
                        <br/>\
                        The team has been working for weeks on something not really sexy and time consuming, but essential for the future of the project: we reviewed our whole <b>development process</b>.\
                        <br/> <br/>This is not very exciting, but here is what you can expect from now:\
                        <ul class="list list--sign">\
                            <li>the updates will be more frequent</li>\
                            <li>the updates will be lighter (i.e. less new features at once)</li>\
                            <li>we will be more reactive to issues and will fix bugs quickly</li>\
                            <li>we will only have two version: unstable and stable</li>\
                        </ul>\
                        You won’t have to wait for months to get a new version with new features, the <b>gap between development and releases</b> will be <b>much smaller</b>.\
                        <br/>\
                        To prepare your recalbox to this new process, a <b>4.0.1 version</b> will be released in <b>some days</b>. Please update when your recalbox warns you about a new version :D\
                        <br/><br/>\
                        And right after that, we will activate the <b>unstable update</b> of your recalbox so you can update to <b>recalbox 4.1.0</b>. It comes with rpi3 bluetooth support, new systems, and many other exciting features!\
                        <br/>\
                        We are counting on you to report issues on our issue board or on the forum :)\
                        <br/><br/>\
                        Once again, we sincerely wish to <b>thank you</b> for all the enthusiasm and loyalty you show towards our project.\
                            <br/><br/>\
                            See you soon !\
                            <br/><br/>\
                        <p>Hum and yeah, we have a blog back :)</p>\
